## 🎓 How It Works (For the Curious)

1. **Your blog** is stored in GitHub (like Google Drive for code)
2. **Vercel** turns it into a website and hosts it (free!)
3. **Tina Cloud** gives you a visual editor at app.tina.io
4. When you save in Tina → it commits to GitHub → Vercel rebuilds → blog updates!

Everything happens automatically. You just write and click save.
